The plan to test this program is as follows: 

First, test on a single file. Make sure all the words are correctly counted.

Then give it a directory with multiple files in it. 

Make sure the words are counted correctly and the output is printed correctly.

We have supplied 3 directories, and a file called test.txt to test with. 

The directories are: 
test1/
test2/
test3/
