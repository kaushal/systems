Test plan for program:

The plan for testing this program revolves around inserting and deleting nods while steping through the list with iterators.


case1: 
insert
12
13
1
2
3
5
create iterators
step through, while inserting and deleting random nodes


case2:
insert 1
iterate
delete 1
insert 2

case3:
insert 3
insert 2
insert 1

delete 3, 2, 1


case4:
insert:
12
56
1
2
3
5

insert 2

delete
56
12
1
2
3
5
